# PDF Generation Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix Steps

If the PDF generation is not working, follow these steps in order:

### 1. Check Browser Console
- Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to the Console tab
- Look for any error messages in red
- The console should show debug information about what's happening

### 2. Verify Required Elements Exist
The page must have these HTML elements:
```html
<div id="reportContainer">
    <!-- Your report content goes here -->
</div>

<button id="generatePdfBtn">Generate PDF</button>
```

### 3. Check Required Libraries
Make sure these libraries are loaded:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2canvas/1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js"></script>
```

### 4. Test with the Test Page
Use the `test-pdf.html` file I created to test if the basic functionality works.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "PDF button not found"
**Solution**: Make sure your HTML has a button with `id="generatePdfBtn"`

### Issue: "Report container not found"
**Solution**: Make sure your HTML has a div with `id="reportContainer"`

### Issue: "jsPDF library not loaded"
**Solution**: Check that the jsPDF script is loading correctly

### Issue: "html2canvas library not loaded"
**Solution**: Check that the html2canvas script is loading correctly

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Make sure you're using `type="module"` when including the reports.js file

## Debug Information

The enhanced version now includes detailed console logging. You should see:

```
Reports page DOM ready, initializing...
Report container found: true/false
PDF button found: true/false
Setting up PDF generation...
Enhanced PDF UI created successfully
PDF-optimized CSS injected successfully
Report container optimized for PDF successfully
```

## Manual Testing

If nothing works, try this simple test:

1. Open the browser console
2. Type: `window.generatePDFReport`
3. If it returns a function, the basic setup is working
4. If it returns undefined, there's a fundamental loading issue

## File Structure Requirements

Your project should have this structure:
```
your-project/
├── assets/
│   └── js/
│       └── pages/
│           └── reports.js
├── your-html-page.html
└── test-pdf.html (optional test file)
```

## Still Not Working?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify all required HTML elements** exist with correct IDs
3. **Ensure all JavaScript libraries** are loading correctly
4. **Try the test page** (`test-pdf.html`) to isolate the issue
5. **Check for JavaScript syntax errors** in the reports.js file

## Contact Information

If you continue to have issues, please provide:
- The exact error message from the browser console
- Your HTML structure (especially the report container and PDF button)
- Which browser you're using
- Whether the test page works
